# Ames_Housing_Analysis
The goal of this project is to predict the age and sell price of a house within the Ames Housing Dataset. Data visualization and standardization is performed. Data is analyzed using multivariate linear regression, and I contextualize my findings by analyzing the residuals of the model.
